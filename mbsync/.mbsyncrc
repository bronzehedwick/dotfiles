# IMAP keeps an "internaldate" attribute for messages, which is separate from
# the date given in the message header, set based upon when the message was
# first received. Fastmail's webmail interface at least uses this attribute to
# properly order messages chronologically. The CopyArrivalDate option isn't
# well documented but it seems that when synchronising a new message it uses
# the Maildir file's Modify date as the IMAP internaldate attribute and vice
# versa. Otherwise it seemed the synchronisation time was being used instead.
# By setting the option here it's enabled by default for all Channels.
CopyArrivalDate yes
